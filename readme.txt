Easily repeat sections of code across your site by turning it into a shortcode.

== Description ==

The Cone Clode plugin allows you to setup pieces of code and turn it into a shortcode. You can then use this shortcode on your posts, pages, widgets, product pages (if using an Ecommerce plugin like Woocommerce or WP Commerce) to easily replicate this code across your site. You can also use other shortcodes within this code fragment as well. This also means that if you want to update this code in future, you can just do it once from within this plugin, and it will update across your site.

This plugin was developed in particular for Ecommerce sites, to be able to easily add policies to product descriptions that can then be updated in future without having to go and change every single product description. It really does have a thousand other uses though, and any time you need to replicate or clone a piece of code across your site, this is the way to do it.
